# ShutdownTimer

I wanted to make a computer shutdown application for myself because I was tired of constantly shutting
down my computer with commands via cmd. Actually, at first, I thought of it as a simple one-button
application where only time is entered. But as time passed, I enjoyed dealing with it and wanted
to make something that looked better in visually.

In fact, it took a very short time to make the working part of the application, namely the codes.
It was all finished in one day. But I had to constantly delete and add some things because I was dealing with the visual part.

Just when I thought I had finished everything, I wanted to give the names of the labels more understandable.
At this point, many things broke down. I don't know why, but even though I did it through the 'properties' interface,
the old names remained in codes, I had to delete and correct them one by one.

I fixed them, got the export of the app. But there were unnecessary files. .json files and some .dll's.
I didn't want to show them to people. Also, when someone wants to use the program, I didn't want them to deal with junk files.
So I wanted to publish the application as a single .exe. 
It was definitely a very easy thing, but I tried too hard. I've been dealing with some bugs all the time.
It even gave an error because it didn't write -windows in the 'target framework'.

Anyway, in conclusion, here is my first C# application, computer shutdown program with timer.
In addition, the codes are completely open source. You can use it as you wish and publish it as you wish.
I do not claim any rights. But it would be nice if you just give it a star. Thank you so much :))
